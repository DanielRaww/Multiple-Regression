##Download the file lifeexp2015 from Blackboard into your working directory.
##I will have this file downloaded in my working directory, so do not worry about adding extra folder information.

##Place a command to remove all variables from your environment at the very beginning of your script

###Evaluate the dataset for missing data and for numerical data types.
###Subset out categorical variables in the first 2 columns.

###For each model, include the following:
###a. Your final model regression equation (after you have deleted any outliers or made any transformations)
###b. An interpretation of important output statistics from the final regression including:
## your overall model test and whether it was statistically significant,
## the R-squared/adjusted R squared in comments,
## the results of the hypothesis test and an interpretation as to what it means.  

#####c. Model diagnostics including statistics and visualizations:
#- Assess linearity of each model
#- Assess normality of residual distribution for each model
#- Assess heteroskedasticity for each model
#- Determine if there any outliers for each model?
##if outliers are present, name the most problematic outlier row(s) found in the initial model assessment in the comments.
##Removing outliers in one at a time, run the model with/without the most problematic outlier(s) to see if the model improves.
##give a rationale for why you should keep the outliers or remove them from the interpretation of the model.
#- Assess multicollinearity for each model if appropriate

#### Model 1 - Multiple Regression
##Considering only the continuous variables in the dataset, give the best prediction using multiple linear regression of Life.expectancy using Forward Selection, Backward Selection,
## or Mixed Selection.

### Model 2: Interaction
##Examine whether an interaction between Income.composition.of.resources and HIV.AIDS has an effect on Life.expectancy.
##Include any visualizations that helped you come to this conclusion.

### Model 3: Transformation
##Examine the relationship between GDP and life expectancy. Evaluate a nonlinear polynomial relationship of GDP that best predicts Life.expectancy
##Include any visualizations that helped you come to this conclusion.
